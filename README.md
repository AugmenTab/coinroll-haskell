# Coin Roll - Haskell

This application is a proof-of-concept for a customizable cryptocurrency dashboard. It allows the user to search a database of cryptocurrencies and create watchlist of those that interest them. Their watchlist provides current financial and portfolio information on the cryptocurrencies in their watchlist. They can also insert a transaction record, a purchase or a sell, and see a summary of their portfolio that includes data like their current investment's value and the profit they've made so far, on both a per-cryptocurrency and overall scale.

### External Services

* [CoinMarketCap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/): The API I chose to use for providing cryptocurrency information. The Basic level is free, and permits 333 "credits" (typically a call with less than 100 coins on it will cost a single credit) per day, and up to 10,000 "credits" per month. It has a much more limited suite of information available, but for this proof of concept, it is more than sufficient.
* More coming soon!
